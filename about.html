                        <p>
                            Women Techmakers is a global program created by Google to highlight the talent of women in technology. Together with other sponsors and partners, Google is supporting the development of women in technology.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Women Techmakers Hamburg is independent from Google and our other partners. The events and speakers that we selected are based our ideas and knowledge. This community promotes talented and passionate women and increases the visibility of the Hamburg tech community while honoring women in technology.

                            Respect, trust, fairness, embrace differences, sharing and supporting, improvement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our values are what we think everyone should be based on. They are also what we use to benchmark our actions. We want everyone respected as a person, having them trusted, treated in a fair manner.

                            We want to have equality in value while understanding the differences &mdash; we think that using different mindsets together delivers way better quality. We want information to be shared and colleagues to be supported, all for the purpose of continuous improvement.

                        <p>
                            Equality and diversity in STEM regardless of gender. This is the world we are dreaming of. A world where women don’t have to give 120% to be taken full. A world where men and women are working together in exploring science, developing technology, constructing engineering and building a mathematical foundation. A world where the choice of a specific major in studying is not a question of gender.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We might often talk about men and women, but we are aware of the wider range which exists, the specific views of cis- and transgender people, the aspects of non-binary and of agender persons. A career or education choice in STEM has to be independent of gender identity.
